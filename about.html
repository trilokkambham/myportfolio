                    <p>
                        <br>My name is TRILOK SAI KAMBHAM, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science 
                        in Computer Science at the University of Central Oklahoma, with an expected 
                        graduation in 2026. I consider myself a dynamic individual with a strong passion 
                        for continuous learning and growth. I am dedicated to constantly improving my 
                        skills and knowledge to contribute effectively to my organization and make a 
                        positive impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>I successfully completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering 
                        with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Chandigarh 
                        University in 2023. I achieved a grade of 7.5 out of 10 points, reflecting my 
                        dedication and commitment to academic excellence. This program equipped me with  
                        a solid foundation in computer science principles and advanced knowledge in AI and ML
                        technologies. This educational background has prepared me well for my current pursuit 
                         of a Master's degree, where I continue to explore and expand my expertise in the 
                         field of computer science and its applications
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>During my academic journey, I actively engaged in various projects, refining 
                        my problem-solving skills and gaining hands-on experience. These projects include 
                        a Plant Disease Classification Web App, Secure Cloud File Storage, and B2B Payment 
                        Prediction. Each project showcases my ability to apply theoretical concepts to 
                        practical solutions in full-stack development and data analysis, demonstrating 
                        my expertise in leveraging technology to address real-world challenges. 
                        Detailed descriptions of these projects can be found in the projects section, 
                        highlighting my innovative approach and commitment to excellence in software 
                        engineering and data science.
